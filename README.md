The goal of this tool is to help new players understand the intricate details under the hood of **Risk of Rain 2**. __Phase 1__ allows the player to learn about each item, granting them a better understanding of what can be achieved in an average run. __Phase 2__ will introduce functionality that teaches players about item synergies and how items can come together to form a well rounded build. __Phase 3__ will combine the existing functionality with a tool that explains how effectively the selected item can be used by each survivor. The __final phase__ will be oriented around teaching the player how to manage their inventory and visualise builds as they pick up items in the early stages of the game, this will focus on an in-depth understanding of synergies and the use of scrappers/printers to achieve a build concentrated on a core game mechanic.
