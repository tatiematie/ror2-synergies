# ror2-synergies
The goal of this tool is to help new players understand the intricate details under the hood of **Risk of Rain 2**. Find it here: https://tatiematie.github.io/ror2-synergies/

## Roadmap
#### Phase 1: Introduction **(~~Complete~~)**
Phase 1 of this project introduces a wiki-style collection of every item in the game. Selecting an item shows its information in the display panel, item information includes: rarity, description with stats, and proc coefficients.

#### Phase 2: Synergies **(WIP)**
Phase 2 will implement item synergies into the display panel. Selecting an item will show other items that pair well with it to form a well-rounded build.

#### Phase 3: Survivors **(Planned)**
Phase 3 will implement survivor-item synergies into the display panel. Selecting an item will show survivors and skills that make good use of it.
