# ror2-synergies
This tool aims to help new players understand the intricate details under the hood of **Risk of Rain 2**. Find it here: [https://tatiematie.github.io/ror2-synergies/].

## Roadmap
**Phase 1: Introduction (~~Complete~~)**
Introduced a wiki-style collection of every item in the game. Selecting an item shows its information in the display panel, item information includes rarity, description with stats, and proc coefficients.

**Phase 2: Synergies (QA)**
Will implement item synergies into the display panel. Selecting an item will show other items that pair well with it to form a well-rounded build.

**Phase 3: Survivors (Planned)**
Will implement survivor-item synergies into the display panel. Selecting an item will show survivors and skills that use it well.

## Suggested Features
**Anti-synergies (muddii#0)**
A section in the item's description that display's item's that players should avoid picking up in conjunction with the selected item.
