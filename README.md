# ror2-synergies
The goal of this tool is to help new players understand the intricate details under the hood of **Risk of Rain 2**. You can find it here: https://tatiematie.github.io/ror2-synergies/

## Roadmap
### Version 1: Introduction **(~~Complete~~)**
**Phase 1** of this project allows the player to learn about each item, granting them a better understanding of what can be achieved in an average run.
- Selecting an item shows its description in the display panel, descriptions include:
    - Item info
    - Proc coefficients

### Version 2: Synergies **(WIP)**
**Phase 2** will introduce functionality that teaches players about item synergies and how items can come together to form a well rounded build.
- Selecting an item will shows its potential synergies in the display panel

### Version 3: Survivors **(Planned)**
**Phase 3** will combine the existing functionality with a tool that explains how effectively the selected item can be used by each survivor.
- Selecting an item will show its usefulness to each survivor in the display panel

### Version 4: Synergy Demos **(Planned)**
The **final phase** will be oriented around teaching the player how to manage their inventory and visualise builds as they pick up items in the early stages of the game, this will focus on an in-depth understanding of synergies and the use of scrappers/printers to achieve a build concentrated on a core game mechanic.
- Library composed of item synergies that demonstrate specific interactions and item builds
- Includes strategies to help players learn about item management and how to utilize scrappers/printers
